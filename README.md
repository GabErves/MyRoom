## Background

#This project was an open source group project that I worked on during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. It is a virtual interior design website that lets users drag and drop items in a specific room theme. 

## Usage

#Users click through the sign in link and then will choose one of 8 of the specific room themes to drag and drop items to decorate their bedroom to their liking. 

#In order to use the program, copy and paste any of the HTML files into this preview site: https://htmlpreview.github.io
